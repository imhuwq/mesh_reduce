# Mesh Reduce

An algorithm to reduce mesh faces implemented in Python.  

This is an implementation of the algorithm developed by Stan Melax in 1998 in [this book](!http%3A%2F%2Fpomax.nihongoresources.com%2Fdownloads%2FPolygonReduction.pdf).  

For anyone who is interested in mesh reduce and want to have this algorithm a try, he should be advised that this algorithm does not suit for all cases, especially for meshes that contain seperated triangle groups.  

Cases like that may produce a mesh with broken faces.
